# KON414E-Final-Project
This projected is developed to apply FastSlam Algorithm in ROS. There are several different codes which included to project.

## ground_truth.xml
This XML snippet adds a Gazebo plugin to a robot's URDF or XACRO file for ground truth data. It publishes the robot's state (position, velocity, etc.) to the /ground_truth/state topic at a rate of 30 Hz, with no Gaussian noise applied. The plugin uses the libgazebo_ros_p3d.so file and operates under the ground_truth namespace.
